        EASY QUESTIONS (1-10 scale):
        - 9-10: Excellent understanding, clear explanation, mentions best practices
        - 7-8: Good understanding, mostly correct, some minor gaps
        - 5-6: Basic understanding, partially correct, some confusion
        - 3-4: Limited understanding, significant errors
        - 1-2: Poor understanding, mostly incorrect
        
        MEDIUM QUESTIONS (1-10 scale):
        - 9-10: Advanced understanding, excellent explanation, considers edge cases
        - 7-8: Good understanding, solid explanation, minor gaps
        - 5-6: Adequate understanding, some good points, some errors
        - 3-4: Basic understanding, significant gaps or errors
        - 1-2: Poor understanding, major errors
        
        HARD QUESTIONS (1-10 scale):
        - 9-10: Expert level, comprehensive answer, shows deep knowledge
        - 7-8: Advanced level, good understanding, minor gaps
        - 5-6: Intermediate level, adequate but incomplete
        - 3-4: Basic level, significant gaps for this difficulty
        - 1-2: Inadequate for this difficulty level
        
        SCORING FACTORS:
        - Technical Accuracy (40%): Is the technical content correct?
        - Completeness (25%): Does it address all parts of the question?
        - Clarity (20%): Is the explanation clear and well-structured?
        - Relevance (15%): Does it directly answer the question asked?
        
        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        - If answer is too short (< 20 words), deduct 2-3 points
        - If answer is completely off-topic, score 1-2
        - If answer shows no understanding, score 1-3
        - If answer is partially correct but incomplete, score 4-6
        - If answer is correct but lacks depth for the difficulty, score 6-7
